BAD GUY BLACK
A Font by S. John Ross
Cumberland Games & Diversions

I've made a lot of stress fonts, but BAD GUY BLACK is about more than stress, it's about age. This came after a bout of Fly From Evil research, staring at quite a lot of nearly-a-century old documents, and trying to isolate what, graphically, made a font feel not only stressed, but actually old. I think it came out pretty well; hope you like it!
